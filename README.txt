Bells + Whistles:

(3 points)  I Implemented basic calculator memory functions: M+, M-, MC, MR. M+ and M- are used to add or subtract from memory, while M- clears the current memory and MR displays the current value held in memory.

(3 points) I increased the functionality of the clear button by letting users backspace one character at a time with a short press of the button, or clear the whole buffer with a long press of the button.

I incorporated an alternative layout that should activate in landscape mode.
